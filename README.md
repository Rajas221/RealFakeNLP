Fake-Real News Text Classifier 
This current model is a text classifier, not a fact-checker.
I have used NLP NLTK resources followed with TF-IDF Vectorizer.
The model is baseline trained with the logistic regression model giving exceptional results for text classification.
The process and additional information is added as comments in my code.

This model includes
1) Data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?resource=download)
2) fake_news_model.pkl
3) tfidf_vectorizer.pkl

The steps to implement are highlighted in the code.
