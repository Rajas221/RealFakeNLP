Fake-Real News Text Classifier 
This current model is a text classifier, not a fact-checker.
I have used NLP NLTK resources followed with TF-IDF Vectorizer.
The model is baseline trained with the logistic regression model giving exceptional results for text classification.
The process and additional information is added as comments in my code.
